## Requirements

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- Understand the [GitFlow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
    >This is the workflow we utilize across the project for branching method.

## Getting Started

1. Install packages

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2. Start project

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. The application is now running on http://localhost:3000.

    >Nuxt.js will listen for file changes inside the pages directory, so there is no need to restart the application when adding or updating pages.

## Testing

**Coming Soon (TODO)**

## Deployment

Deployments will occur automtically with merges into `master`. Merges into master should be limited to specific release branches or hotfixes, as needed.

- Redesign deployments will need to occur in more wholistic updates.
- Performance or tech debt improvements can occur more individually.
